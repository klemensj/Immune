# Adaptive Immunity 1.0

Teaching model demonstrating adaptive immunity

This model was created by Sarah Gift and Jeff Klemens. Its intended use is as a classroom teaching model for demonstrating adaptive immunity as generated by clonal selection of antibodies in the immune system. The `Immune.nlogo` file contains background readings and a lesson plan for teaching with this model within the info tab. The `LESSON_PLAN.md` file contains a self-contained lesson plan that overlaps with the info tab of the model file but is organized as a step by step guide to using the model in a classroom setting. A deployed html version of the model (runs slower but major dynamics are fine) is temporarily located here:  http://fixedfocussolutions.com/PhilaU_stuff/Immune_working.html and will eventually be relocated to the Netlogo modeling commons.
